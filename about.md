I am a PhD student in economics at the University of Salzburg (Austria), advised by Professor Florian Huber. During my PhD, I completed a research stay at Bocconi University in Milan (Italy), hosted by Professor Massimiliano Marcellino.

My research interests include Bayesian time series analysis, with a particular focus on vector autoregressions and covariance modeling.
