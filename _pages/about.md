I am a PhD student in economics at the University of Salzburg (Austria), advised by Professor Florian Huber. Currently, I am conducting a research stay at Bocconi
University Milan (Italy), where I am working with Professor Massimiliano Marcellino.

My research interests include Bayesian time series analysis with a particular focus on Vector Autoregressions and covariance modeling.
