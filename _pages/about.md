I am a PhD student in economics at the University of Salzburg (Austria), advised by Professor Florian Huber. In the course of my PhD studies I also conducted a research stay at Bocconi
University Milan (Italy), hosted by Professor Massimiliano Marcellino.

My research interests include Bayesian time series analysis with a particular focus on vector autoregressions and covariance modeling.
