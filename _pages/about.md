I'm a PhD student in economics at the University of Salzburg (Austria),  supervised by Professor Florian Huber. Currently, I'm conducting a research stay at Bocconi
University Milan (Italy), where I'm working with Professor Massimiliano Marcellino.

My research interests include Bayesian time series analysis with a particular focus on Vector Autoregressions and Covariance Modeling.
